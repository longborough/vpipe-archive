This is intended as a chaotic contribution of ideas for the [nushell Project](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)

Please note that the examles here are of IBM VM/CMS Pipelines and Rexx programming, and are often devoid of comments. 
As a result, up to 30-odd years later, I can't even remember what some of them are for.
